# TO-DO-LIST
## Description
it is a SPA the user can add a thing to do and then he can delete it, check on it or delete all the list. the design is responsive.
## Languages
HTML, css and vanilla JS. 
I used media query to make different screen sizes and used manuplated DOM to make all functions.
## Resources
this idea and style guid from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW) and found this page [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp)helpful in writting main function.
### Thoughts
the challenge had more functions like filter but I found it difficult and it was not working with me. I think if used jQuery or advanced technicks than vanilla JS will be easier and working will.
eather ways it is a good practice for me in html and css. this project push me to learn more about js.
